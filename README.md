# Rule-Based Bad Posture Detection System

This is a simple frontend project developed using React.

The aim of this project is to understand how posture detection systems work
using basic rule-based logic. The application simulates posture checking
and displays whether the posture is good or bad.

## Features
- Simple and clean user interface
- Rule-based posture checking logic
- Displays posture status
- Built using React and Vite

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js

## How it Works
When the user clicks on the "Check Posture" button, the system runs a
simple logic condition and generates posture status. Based on this logic,
the system shows whether the posture is good or bad.
